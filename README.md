# MacroCalc

Simple tool to calculate the macros for a recipe given a list of ingredients.

## How does it work?

[Cole's](https://coles.com.au) and the [USDA Food Database](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov) are used to
search for products and nutritional information. When the user types an ingredient, a list of
matching products with their nutritional information is produced.
