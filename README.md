# MacroCalc

Simple tool to calculate the macros of a recipe given a list of ingredients.

## How does it work?

[Cole's](coles.com.au) is used to search for products and nutritional information. When the user
types an ingredient, a list of matching products is produced. When the desired product is selected,
the page for the product is downloaded and parsed using a large language model to extract the
nutritional information.
